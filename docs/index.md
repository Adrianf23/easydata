# Easydata
_A python framework and git template for data scientists, teams, and workshop organizers
aimed at making your data science work **reproducible and shareable**_

For most of us, data science is 5% science, 60% data cleaning, and 35%
IT hell.  Easydata focuses the 95% by helping you deliver

* reproducible python environments,
* reproducible datasets, and
* reproducible workflows

In other words, Easydata is a template, library, and workflow that lets you **get up and running with your data science analysis, quickly and reproducibly**.

## What is Easydata?

Easydata is a python cookiecutter for building custom data science git repos that provides:

* An [**opinionated workflow**](opinions.md) for collaboration, storytelling,
* A **python framework** to support this workflow,
* A **makefile wrapper** for conda and pip environment management,
* A catalog of prebuilt **dataset recipes**, and
* A library of training materials and documentation around doing reproducible data science.

Easydata is **not**

* an ETL tooklit
* A data analysis pipeline
* a containerization solution, or
* a prescribed data format.

## Contributing

The Easydata project is opinionated, but not afraid to be wrong. Best practices change, tools evolve, and lessons are learned. **The goal of this project is to make it easier to start, structure, and share your data science work.** [Pull requests](https://github.com/hackalog/cookiecutter-easydata/pulls) and [filing issues](https://github.com/hackalog/cookiecutter-easydata/issues) is encouraged. We'd love to hear what works for you, and what doesn't.

Easydata started life as an [opinionated fork](opinions.md) of the [cookiecutter-datascience] project. Easydata has evolved considerably since then with a specific focus on enabling overall team efficiency by improving collaboration and reproducibility.
We owe the cookiecutter-datascience project a great debt for the work they have done in creating
a flexible but highly useful project template.

Also, a huge thanks to the
[Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
project ([github](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)), which is
helping us all spend less time thinking about and writing boilerplate
and more time getting things done.
